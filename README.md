The primary objective of our study is to develop an automated system for disease detection in Pepper plants using deep learning techniques, specifically CNNs. By harnessing the power of CNNs, we aim to create a robust and scalable solution capable of accurately identifying common diseases such as Damping off disease, Leaf spot, and Mosaic virus in Pepper plant leaves. Our system will streamline the process of disease diagnosis, enabling farmers and producers to detect and manage plant diseases more effectively, thereby minimizing crop losses and improving agricultural productivity. Additionally, our system will provide actionable insights by recommending appropriate remedies for detected diseases, thereby empowering farmers with the knowledge needed to mitigate the impact of diseases on their crops. Overall, our objective is to leverage advanced technology to revolutionize disease management practices in agriculture and foster a culture of disease-awareness among farmers and agricultural stakeholders.
